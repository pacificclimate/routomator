# routomator

The Routomator bundles together two packages to generate the routing input for the the VIC model. `flowgen` takes a 15 arc second accumulation file and simplifies this to 1/16th degree resolution. `pyroutomator` creates all other VIC routing input files.

Further details can be found in each folder's README files.
